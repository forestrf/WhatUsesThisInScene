# WhatUsesThisInScene

Some UnityEvent or script, or anything, is pointing to some other thing in the scene and applying changes to it, but you can't find who? Well, this won't tell you who is doing it, but will list all the fields that point to that object in the scene, making it easier to find the culprit.

# How to use it
- Right click on a GameObject in the Hierarchy Window, or click on the cog (or three dots) on a component in the Inspector Window, and click "What Uses This In The Scene".
- Check the results on the Console Window.
